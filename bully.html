        <h1 class="aboutus">District Bully Policy</h1>
        <p>
            The Central A&M School District supports and values all of our students and staff. We are a public school that welcomes and supports all. We are continually striving to create an inclusive environment as our school and community grow and become more diverse. There is absolutely no rationale, excuse or tolerance for bullying in ANY context, place, time, or situation. Bullying hurts other human beings. We can disagree and not harm others. It must be stated that we can only investigate and address complaints and allegations of bullying IF we are aware of them. We encourage anyone to come forward with information about any situation by letting your building principals or the superintendent know.  

We also encourage the use of our anonymous reporting form, found here: Bullying Tip Form (Anonymous).

 

The board policy that covers Bullying is Board Policy 7:180.

 

While the hunger by some individuals for information is obvious, as a public school we owe it, legally and otherwise, to all students and families to maintain their privacy, confidentiality, and dignity. The lack of detailed information released in any situation does not constitute a “cover up” or “sweeping things under the rug”. Parents and the general public will not be apprised by the school district of the details of any investigation involving our students or staff, or the specific disciplinary action that is taken, or the specific restorative measures that are instituted. In the spirit of supporting and valuing all of our students and staff, please be cognizant of the fact that our actions as adults on-line or in person set an example. As a district we will always look toward kindness, seeking greater understanding and respect of each other.
